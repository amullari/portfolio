# Salary Management Tool (_Palgakorraldus_)

The objective of this data analysis is to create a **user-friendly analysis tool for HR staff**. Artificial (dummy) data used for this tool was generated with the help of ChatGPT.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how data analysis can support **pay transparency** and **equitable compensation** in an organization.  

The Power BI report visualizes gender pay gaps, workforce composition, and structural factors influencing salary differences.  

It enables HR professionals to explore salaries by **category, level, and gender**, and to identify key drivers of pay disparities.


## 📸 Key Visualizations

Below are selected views from the Power BI report illustrating the main analytical perspectives:
### Salary Ranges

Visual overview of salary dispersion across job categories and levels. Wide ranges and outliers highlight potential inconsistencies in role grading and compensation practices. Used to quickly identify areas that require deeper investigation.

### Salary Range Cross Table

Compact tabular view of salary ranges by category and level. Provides precise numerical comparison where visual overview is not sufficient.

### Gender Pay Gap by Category

Bar chart showing gender pay gap across job families and levels. Categories are sorted by decreasing pay gap to highlight the most critical areas. Pay gaps above 5% are flagged as potential risk indicators. Supporting lines show average male and female salaries for context.

### Male vs Female Salaries by Position

Scatter plot comparing average male and female salaries per job position. Point size reflects the number of employees. Positions above the diagonal indicate higher male salaries, positions below indicate higher female salaries. Used to detect structural imbalance at role level.

Scatter Plot is connected with interactive table showing employee-level salary details. Clicking any chart filters the table accordingly. Supports root-cause analysis behind observed pay gaps and anomalies.
