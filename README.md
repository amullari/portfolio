# About the Portfolio

This portfolio showcases selected learning and demonstration projects from my experience in ERP, data analysis, and HR analytics. Each project highlights practical applications of data, system development, and reporting, with a focus on actionable insights and clear presentation.

## [Salary Analysis – Salary Management Tool](https://github.com/amullari/portfolio/tree/main/project1-salary-analysis/README.md)
Demonstrates HR data analysis using synthetic salary data to explore pay transparency, gender equality, and equitable compensation.

Includes interactive Power BI visualizations for salary ranges, gender pay gaps, and employee-level drill-downs.

Serves as a preparatory tool for HR decision-making and aligns conceptually with the **EU Pay Transparency Directive**, without replacing official reporting or national reporting solutions.
